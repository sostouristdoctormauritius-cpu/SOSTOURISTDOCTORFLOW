Based on my analysis of the SOSDOCMOBILEAPP codebase, I can provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the application and propose a reorganization plan.

App Analysis
Overview
This is a healthcare mobile application designed to connect patients with doctors through various digital services. It's built with React Native and currently functions as a showcase app that demonstrates different screens and flows.

Key Features and Patient/Doctor Solutions

Solves: Centralized access point for all healthcare services
Consultation Services

Instant online consultations (chat/video)
Symptom selection and doctor matching
Appointment booking and management
Solves: Enables remote healthcare access, reducing need for physical visits
Prescription Management

Current Structure Issues
Assets Disorganization

Assets scattered across multiple directories (assets/ and src/assets)
Deep nested folder structures with feature-specific subdirectories
Redundant image variants (@1x, @2x, @3x) without clear usage patterns
Screens Organization

Mixed flat and nested structure in src/screens
Inconsistent naming and categorization
Some screens in subdirectories (Unauthenticated/CompleteProfile)
Navigation Complexity

Multiple navigation files (AppNavigator, AuthenticatedStack, ModalStack, ShowcaseNavigator)
Showcase pattern that allows access to all screens from a menu
Overly complex for a showcase app
Proposed Reorganization Plan
1. Consolidated Navigation System
Keep only essential navigation components
Create a single, simple stack navigator
Replace showcase pattern with logical user flows
Remove unnecessary navigation complexity
2. Assets Consolidation
Move all used assets to a single src/assets directory
Organize by asset type (images, icons) rather than feature
Remove unused assets and redundant variants
Establish clear naming conventions
3. Screens Reorganization
Move all screens to src/screens directory
Create logical subdirectories only when necessary (auth, consultation, profile)
Eliminate deeply nested folder structures
Ensure consistent naming conventions
4. Pages Directory Implementation
Create src/pages for higher-level page components
Use pages to compose multiple screens or components
Separate business logic from UI components
Benefits of This Approach
Improved Maintainability: All assets and screens in predictable locations
Enhanced Developer Experience: Clear organization makes it easier to find and modify components
Reduced Complexity: Eliminating the showcase pattern reduces unnecessary navigation complexity
Better Asset Management: Consolidating assets makes it easier to identify and remove unused resources
Scalability: Clean structure allows for easier future enhancements
Implementation Approach
If you approve this plan, I would implement it in the following phases:

Asset Consolidation

Identify all used assets throughout the app
Move them to a unified src/assets directory
Remove unused assets
Update all import paths
Screen Reorganization

Move all screens to src/screens
Create logical subdirectories for grouping
Update all import paths
Navigation Simplification

Create a single, simple navigation system
Remove showcase pattern
Implement logical user flows
Page Structure Implementation

Create src/pages directory
Move higher-level components to pages
Establish clear separation between screens and pages

This approach align with our vision for the reorganization, proceed with implementation!
